<h1>ticalendar Module</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The Calendar and Event module allows you to display a Calendar, along with
create, search and destroy events from the iphone's calendar. </p>

<h2>Accessing the ticalendar Module</h2>

<p>To access this module from JavaScript, you would do the following:</p>

<pre><code>var ticalendar = require("com.ti.calendar");
</code></pre>

<p>The ticalendar variable is a reference to the Module object.    </p>

<h2>Reference</h2>

<h3>Com.Ti.Calendar.createItem</h3>

<p>This is the function that is called to create a new event. Currently, only
title and startDate are accepted. The events default to a duration of 20
minutes. The item is in MEMORY only at this point, to save it into the 
iphone's calendar, you will need to call saveEvent()</p>

<p>Ex: var ev = Calendar.createItem({title:"Stefs Event", startDate: new Date()});</p>

<h3>Com.Ti.Calendar.saveEvent</h3>

<p>Invoking this function on a previously created calendar event will save it.
A dictionary will be passed back, with status and any error message if 
appropriate.</p>

<p>Ex: var p = ev.saveEvent();</p>

<h3>Com.Ti.Calendar.findEvents</h3>

<p>Calling this function, and passing in a start and end date will return a 
dictionary of event items from the calendar (upto 9999). </p>

<p>Ex: var o = Calendar.findEvents({ start: startDate, end: endDate });</p>

<h3>Com.Ti.Calendar.deleteEvent();</h3>

<p>This will cause the event to be deleted from the iphone's calendar. A
dictionary will be passed back, with status and any error message.</p>

<p>Ex: var g = ev.deleteEvent();</p>

<h3>Com.Ti.Calendar.createView();</h3>

<p>This will display the calendar widget/view. This is not required for
any of the other functions to work. It currently can take a color for
background, a dictionary of events (from the findEvents call), and 
you can also register a callback function for whenever a date is clicked.
In the case of a date being clicked that has events, a structure similiar
to findEvents will be passed back.</p>

<p>Ex: var foo = Calendar.createView({color:"lightgray", events: o,
        eventsSelected: function(e) {
              for (key in e.events) {
                  alert(e.events[key].title+" starts at "+e.events[key].startDate+" and has id of "+e.events[key].eventIdentifier);
              }
        }
    });</p>
